Subject: I built this because I was tired of spending hours repurposing content

Hey [Name],

I have a confession: I used to spend 80% of my time repurposing content and only 20% creating it.

Sound familiar?

You'd write an amazing blog post, then spend hours crafting the perfect tweet thread, LinkedIn post, Instagram caption... the same ideas, different formats, endless work.

That's why I built AI Content Repurposer.

As a solo developer and content creator myself, I was living this pain daily. I tried existing tools, but they were either:
- Too expensive for bootstrapped creators
- Too generic (they'd butcher my voice)
- Too complex (I just wanted to paste and go)

So I built exactly what I needed: a tool that understands platform differences, maintains your voice, and gets you 80% there in 2 minutes instead of 100% there in 2 hours.

**What makes it different:**
✓ Built by a creator who lives the struggle daily
✓ Understands each platform's unique style and limits
✓ Free tier that's actually useful (5 repurposes/month)
✓ Pro plan that's affordable for solo creators ($5/month)
✓ No complex setup - paste content, select formats, done

**Real results from early users:**
- Sarah (tech blogger): "Cut my content repurposing from 3+ hours to 10 minutes"
- Marcus (YouTuber): "Finally, threads that sound like threads, not chopped blog posts"
- Priya (newsletter writer): "My engagement doubled since I started posting consistently"

I'm launching publicly today after 3 months of building and testing with 1000+ creators.

Thanks for being part of this journey,

P.S. I personally respond to every piece of feedback. This tool exists because of creator input, and it'll keep improving the same way.

### Twitter/X Launch Thread
```
🧵 Thread: Why I spent 3 months building AI Content Repurposer as a solo dev

I was spending 80% of my time repurposing content, 20% creating it.

Here's the tool I built to fix that (and why I chose to bootstrap instead of raise VC) 👇

1/ The problem was real:
- Write 1 blog post → 3 hours
- Turn it into social content → 3 MORE hours
- Repeat weekly = 24 hours/month just repurposing

I was a content creation machine, but most of my time was copy-paste-edit hell.

2/ Existing tools didn't work:
❌ Too expensive ($50+/month)
❌ Generic outputs (lost my voice)
❌ Complex setup (I just wanted paste → go)
❌ Didn't understand platform differences

I needed something built BY a creator FOR creators.

3/ So I built it myself.

3 months, 1000+ beta users, countless iterations.

The result: Turn 1 blog post into 10 social posts in under 2 minutes.

✓ Understands Twitter threads vs LinkedIn posts vs IG captions
✓ Maintains your voice and tone
✓ Actually affordable ($5/month Pro, free tier available)

4/ Why bootstrap instead of VC?

Simple: VCs don't understand the creator struggle.

They'd want me to:
- Charge $99/month
- Add enterprise features
- Focus on "scale" over creators

I wanted to build for people like me: solo creators who need their time back.

5/ Real results from users:

"Cut repurposing from 3+ hours to 10 minutes" - Sarah, tech blogger

"Finally, threads that sound like threads" - Marcus, YouTuber  

"My engagement doubled" - Priya, newsletter writer

6/ The tool is live today.

Free tier: 5 repurposes/month (no signup required)
Pro: $5/month for unlimited + premium formats

Try it: [Your URL]

Building in public has been incredible. Thanks to everyone who gave feedback, tested early versions, and believed in this vision.

7/ What's next?

- Custom tone training
- Team collaboration features  
- Direct social scheduling
- More platform formats

Follow along: I share revenue, user feedback, and building lessons weekly.

The creator economy needs more tools built BY creators FOR creators.

This is just the start 🚀

### LinkedIn Launch Post
```
After 3 months of building, I'm launching AI Content Repurposer today.

As a solo developer and content creator, I was spending 80% of my time repurposing content instead of creating it.

The problem: You write an amazing blog post, then spend hours crafting platform-specific versions. Same ideas, different formats, endless work.

Existing solutions were either too expensive, too generic, or too complex for solo creators like me.

So I built exactly what I needed:

→ Paste your content, select formats, get drafts in 2 minutes
→ Understands platform differences (Twitter threads ≠ LinkedIn posts)
→ Maintains your voice and tone
→ Actually affordable for bootstrapped creators

Why I chose to bootstrap instead of raise VC:
• VCs would push for $99/month pricing
• They'd want enterprise features over creator needs
• I wanted to build for people like me, not maximize ARR

Real results from 1000+ beta users:
✓ "Cut repurposing time from 3+ hours to 10 minutes"
✓ "Finally, threads that sound like threads"  
✓ "My engagement doubled since posting consistently"

The creator economy needs more tools built BY creators FOR creators.

Subject: Built this tool because I had the same problem you probably have

Hi [Name],

I've been following your content for a while and love your [specific content type]. 

Quick question: How much time do you spend turning your [blog posts/videos/newsletters] into social media content?

I'm guessing it's way more than you'd like (it was for me).

I just launched AI Content Repurposer - a tool I built because I was spending 80% of my time repurposing content instead of creating it.

Would love to get it in front of creators like you who might find it useful. Happy to give you free Pro access to try it out.

No strings attached - just genuinely think it could save you hours every week.
